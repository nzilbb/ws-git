# Git and version control

## Version control

- Software comes in *versions*
- Developers need to know how versions relate to each other
- Version control systems are the solution
- We have similar problems...

## {background-image="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif" background-size="contain"}

## Why use version control? {.smaller}

- "Your paper relies on whatsit scores for every dongle, but I think you must have
made an error. How did you calculate them?"
    - "...uh, they must be on this old hard drive somewhere... wait... perhaps my
    RA did it?..."
- "We've switched to _sparkly-shiny-new) models this week, but they seem similar to 
the _old-reliable-friendly_ models we fit a few months ago. How do the results of 
the two approaches differ?"
    - "...uh, we replaced them..."
- "Why is your Markdown file longer than _War and Peace_?
    - "...I want to keep all the previous approaches here so I can get access to
    them quickly"
- **[Let's be professional!](https://youtu.be/8qzVV7eEiaI?si=aBV7MhDKTGp_cjK8)**

## Git

- [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a widely used version control system.
- It allows you to track versions and see differences between them
    - ...along with dividing projects into into 'branches', merging distinct
    branches together, etc etc.
- It is *distributed* in the sense that the same project can be on multiple 
computers.
- More controlled than, e.g., just putting your project on dropbox.
    - BTW: you should at least do that.
    
## Git (cont.)

- If used well, say goodbye to `_Final_JWBcomments_v2_postR&R_reallyfinal.docx`
- But there's a learning curve...

## Git vocab

::: fragment
It's best to learn by doing, but...

:::

- **Repo/Repository:** Directory managed by Git.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of the repository.
- **Diff:** The difference between two commits.
- **Remote:** A version of the repository hosted online.
- **Pull:** To get any changes from a remote repository and merge them with
your copy of the repository.
- **Push:** To upload your commits to a remote repository.

![Write a commit message and press 'commit'](images/commit.png)

- Nothing is tracked by Git until it is "committed"
- i.e., saving a document does not commit it.

# GitHub and UC GitLab

## GitHub

- [GitHub](https://github.com) and Git are two different things
- GitHub hosts Git repositories
- Owned by Microsoft
- Widely used to share projects publically.
    - But you can have private git repositories.
- GitHub Pages allows us to host nice-looking supplementary materials.

## UC GitLab

- GitLab is another service for hosting Git repositories
- GitLab.com is very similar to GitHub
- But: UC hosts its own version of GitLab locally.
- Good for collaborating locally.
- [https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/](https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/)

## Big data and models

- GitHub and GitLab are not for storing large files
- Git will ignore all files listen in the `.gitignore` file
- I usually share large files or models using [OSF.io](https://osf.io)
- The limit: 100MB
- If one of you figures out "Git Large File Storage", let me know...

## Risks

- The whole point of Git is version control
- If you share a repository publically, you are sharing its entire history
- Private data has been accidentally leaked this way!

## GitHub first

- Create a repository on GitHub.

::: fragment
![](images/new_repo.png)
:::

- `File -> New Project -> Version Control`
- Paste in the link.


## Or, GitLab first...

:::

## Advice

- Always have a `README.md` file.
    - This is the front page of your repository on GitHub
- **Good:** Frequent small commits.
- **Good:** When collaborating, frequent pushing and pulling.
- Extension: "branches" can be useful for collaboration.

# When things go wrong

## Merge problems

- You and I have both made changes to the repository. How do we **merge**
them together?
- First pusher wins (push often!).
- Second person must pull before they can push.
- If no overlapping changes, there's no problem.
- You probably won't be so lucky... (I'll show you an example later...)

- Sometimes a local repository becomes very hard to sync with the remote.
- **The nuclear option:**
  1. Rename your local repository.
  2. Clone a new copy from GitHub
  3. Make necessary changes (perhaps copying across parts of the old local repository)

# What now?

## What now?

::: fragment
Many options! Some ideas:
:::

- Clone a repository from the NZILBB GitHub inside RStudio.
- Make your own new repository on GitHub and use the link to make a new RStudio
project.
- Make changes to a respository, commit and push.
- Add someone else to your GitHub repository and try to work together.

# Creating a merge conflict
